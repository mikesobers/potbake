<h1>Pot Bake Making Guyanese Style</h1>
<h2>Pot Bake Story </h2></center> 
</hgroup >
<p>When the bread finished cooking, I cut the pot bread open. Then I placed a generous amount of sweet cream butter on a wedge of bread and took a bite. It took me right back to our kitchen in Campbellville and memories of my dad making this bread. And it was so worth it. </p>
<p>My children loved this bread, and I was so happy to share a part of my childhood with them! This pot bread is soft, but solid. </p>
<p>Flipping the dough during cooking compacts the texture of the bread. This gives it a uniqueness that pot bread is known for. I hope you give this recipe a try and relive some of the “olden days,” as my son says. </p>
